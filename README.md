Tutorial parroting what I'm told
As spring sunshine and warmth wake hibernating flora, I'm busily preparing with new raised bed structures, seedlings started under grow lights, compost on order for our no-dig garden and perinneal beds. While this is nourishing and productive, it is also getting a bit in the way of updating my programming skills. There's always something to balance.

Meanwhile, if all works out, I will be on top of HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Git and Github, PHP and various DBMS's. Fortunately, as a veteran IT guy who started out in COBOL on an IBM mainframe and worked my way through various analysis and implementation projects on my way through project management and technology management and executive roles, I am finding that I have the mental models to use and augment as I learn these new skills. Maybe, if only, I will become proficient at web systems development and will be able to keep doing this well into and through retirement.
